**Fish** provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and indenting for [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com) scripts.

It's a direct port of [Omar Zeghouani tree-sitter-fish](https://github.com/ram02z/tree-sitter-fish) to Nova.

The "Indent the Fish script" command runs `fish_indent` on the file.

## Language Support

Fish supports quite a bit of the spec. If major features are missing, please submit PRs to the upstream project. If there are bugs in this extension's bundling of the upstream features, please open a bug!
